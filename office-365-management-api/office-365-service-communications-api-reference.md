# Office 365 Service Communications API reference (Preview)

> [!NOTE] 
> This documentation covers features that are currently in preview.

You can use the Office 365 Service Communications API V2 to access the following data:

- **Get Services**: Get the list of subscribed services.
    
- **Get Current Status**: Get a real-time view of current and ongoing service incidents
    
- **Get Historical Status**: Get a historical view of service incidents.
    
- **Get Messages**: Find Incident and Message Center communications.
    
Currently, the Office 365 Service Communications API contains data for the following services: Dynamics CRM, Dynamics Marketing, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection, Identity Service, Mobile Device Management, Office 365 Partner Admin Center, OneDrive for Business, Parature, OneDrive for Business, Power BI for Office 365, Rights Management Service, SharePoint Online, SHD Admin, Skype for Business, Social Engagement, and Yammer Enterprise.

## The fundamentals

The root URL of the API includes a tenant identifier that scopes the operations to a single tenant:

```http
https://manage.office.com/api/v1.0/{tenant_identifier}/ServiceComms/{operation}
```

The **Office 365 Service Communications API** is a REST service that allows you to develop solutions using any web language and hosting environment that supports HTTPS and X.509 certificates. The API relies on **Microsoft Azure Active Directory** and the **OAuth2** protocol for authentication and authorization. To access the API from your application, you'll need to first register it in Azure AD and configure it with permissions at the appropriate scope. This will enable your application to request OAuth2 access tokens necessary for calling the API. You can find more information about registering and configuring an application in Azure AD at [Office 365 Management APIs getting started](get-started-with-office-365-management-apis.md).

All API requests require an Authorization HTTP header that has a valid OAuth2 JWT access token obtained from Azure AD that contains the **ServiceHealth.Read** claim; and the tenant identifier must match the tenant identifier in the root URL.

```json
Authorization: Bearer {OAuth2 token}
```

### Request headers

These are the supported request headers for all Office 365 Service Communications API operations.

|**Authorization (Required)**|Authorization token (Bearer JWT Azure AD Token) for the request.|


<br/>

## Errors

When the service encounters an error, it reports the error response code to the caller, using standard HTTP error-code syntax. As per [OData V4 specification](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/odata-v4.0-part1-protocol.html), additional information is included in the body of the failed call as a single JSON object. The following is an example of a full JSON error body:


```json
{ 
    "error":{ 
        "code":"AF5000.  An internal server error occurred.",
        "message": "Retry the request." 
    } 
}
```
